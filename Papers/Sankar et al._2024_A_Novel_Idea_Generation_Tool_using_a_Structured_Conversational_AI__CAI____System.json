    "answer": "Traditional ideation techniques often lack active support for novice designers, who face challenges such as design fixation and cognitive fatigue, limiting their ability to generate novel ideas.",
    "evidence": "While these techniques have been widely used, they often lack to provide active support for novice designers. The responsibility for originality and diversity in generating novel ideas essentially rests with the designer. Therefore, these techniques often fail to actively aid and engage novice designers who encounter hurdles during the early stages of idea generation."
