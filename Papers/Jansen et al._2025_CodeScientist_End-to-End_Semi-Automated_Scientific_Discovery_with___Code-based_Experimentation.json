    "evidence": "Despite the surge of interest in autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) of software artifacts, current ASD systems face two key limitations: (1) they largely explore variants of existing codebases or similarly constrained design spaces, and (2) they produce large volumes of research artifacts that are typically evaluated using conference-style paper review with limited evaluation of code."
