  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop an automatic meta-structure discovery framework for heterogeneous information networks that jointly optimizes both empirical prediction performance and semantic explainability. The authors aim to address the limitations of hand-crafted and performance-only meta-structure search methods by leveraging large language model reasoning within an evolutionary search procedure.",
    "evidence": "To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from the emergent reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We propose ReStruct, a meta-structure search framework that integrates LLM reasoning into the evolutionary procedure. ... These two competing forces allow ReStruct to jointly optimize the semantic explainability and empirical performance of meta-structures."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing automatic meta-structure search algorithms for heterogeneous information networks primarily focus on empirical performance, often resulting in complex, hard-to-interpret structures that lack human comprehensibility and generalizability.",
    "evidence": "However, these previous attempts primarily focus on the prediction performance of meta-structures, often resulting in highly complex structures that are challenging to interpret and prone to overfitting. Such “meta-structures” deviate from the original inspiration of meta-structure research that aims to extract semantically clear features from HINs [13]."
