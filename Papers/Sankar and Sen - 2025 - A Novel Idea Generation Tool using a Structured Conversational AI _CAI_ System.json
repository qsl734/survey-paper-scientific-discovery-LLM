  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop and evaluate a novel conversational artificial intelligence-enabled active ideation tool to assist novice designers in overcoming initial latency and bottlenecks in idea generation during product design. The authors aim to compare the effectiveness of this tool against traditional ideation methods using key parameters such as fluency, novelty, and variety. They also seek to enhance the interface with structured dialogue styles for each ideation stage to improve usability and alignment with subsequent design phases.",
    "evidence": "This paper presents a novel conversational AI-enabled active ideation interface as a creative idea-generation tool to assist novice designers in mitigating the initial latency and ideation bottlenecks that are commonly observed... A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Traditional ideation techniques in product design are largely passive, placing the burden of idea generation on the designer and lacking active, dynamic support, especially for novices who face cognitive bottlenecks such as fixation, mental block, and fatigue.",
    "evidence": "While these techniques have been widely used, they often lack to provide active support for novice designers. The responsibility for originality and diversity in generating novel ideas essentially rests with the designer. Therefore, these techniques often fail to actively aid and engage novice designers who encounter hurdles during the early stages of idea generation. These methods lack the dynamism to support designers during their initial ideation."
