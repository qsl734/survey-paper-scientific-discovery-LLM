  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop and evaluate a large language model-based multi-agent system, called Virtual Scientists (VIRSCI), that simulates collaborative scientific idea generation. The authors aim to address the limitations of single-agent and oversimplified multi-agent approaches by creating a system that mimics real-world scientific teamwork using real scientist data and collaboration networks. They seek to demonstrate that this multi-agent approach produces more novel scientific ideas compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
    "evidence": "To address the limitations, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, i.e., Virtual Scientists (VIRSCI), designed to mimic the teamwork inherent in scientific research. VIRSCI organizes a team of agents to collaboratively generate, evaluate, and refine research ideas. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that this multi-agent approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing novel scientific ideas."

    "answer": "Existing artificial intelligence methods for scientific discovery either rely on single-agent systems, which overlook the collaborative nature of real-world research, or use oversimplified collaboration frameworks and unrealistic data, failing to capture the dynamic relationships and mechanisms of actual scientific teams.",
    "evidence": "However, these efforts either rely on a single-agent system, overlooking the collaborative nature of real-world research (Kayacik et al., 2019; Gauch, 2003; Linsey et al., 2005), or employ an oversimplified collaboration framework and unrealistic data (e.g. manually crafted personal profiles, synthetic collaboration networks) to model a multi-agent system, failing to capture the dynamic relationships that characterize real scientific teams. Consequently, they provide limited insights into multi-agent collaboration, which is essential for advancing autonomous scientific discovery."
