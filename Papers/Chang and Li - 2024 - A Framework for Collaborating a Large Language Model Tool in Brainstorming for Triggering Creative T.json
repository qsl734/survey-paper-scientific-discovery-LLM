  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to propose and evaluate a framework (called GPS) that guides designers in systematically collaborating with large language model tools to enhance the creativity of ideas generated during brainstorming. The study aims to address how prompt engineering can be used not just for accuracy, but specifically to foster creativity in brainstorming sessions. The framework is tested through a design example and a case study, with creativity measured using adapted Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking criteria.",
    "evidence": "Therefore, this study addresses this gap by proposing a framework called GPS, which employs goals, prompts, and strategies to guide designers to systematically work with an LLM tool for improving the creativity of ideas generated during brainstorming. Additionally, we adapted the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) for measuring the creativity of the ideas generated by AI."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing research on prompt engineering for large language models focuses primarily on generating accurate responses, neglecting how prompt engineering can be used to enhance creativity, particularly in brainstorming contexts.",
    "evidence": "Accordingly, current studies on prompt engineering focus on improving prompts’ ability to generate accurate responses (which are thinking out of the box). However, how to use prompt engineering to generate creative ideas is neglected."

Therefore, strategies in the context of question-and-answer interactions are used to form proper and purposeful questions that guide LLM’s thinking. By treating an LLM tool as a collaborative partner, strategies introduce various ways of questioning for stimulating innovative ideas and solutions; that is, they influence how initial prompts may be adjusted or refined to elicit more effective responses. The following lists nine strategies that are essential for creative prompt engineering.",
