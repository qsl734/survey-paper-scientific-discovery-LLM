A user prompt describing structural goals, loads, and boundary conditions is processed by the LLM to generate a candidate truss design. The FEM module evaluates the structure’s performance, and a Check module determines whether the constraints are satisﬁed. If feasible, the LLM is prompted to optimize further; if not, it is redirected with a constraint-focused prompt to correct violations. Each solution–score pair is appended to a ranked history of the previous N −1 iterations, which is reinjected into the LLM as structured feedback. This archive enables the LLM to reason over past designs, identify trends, and iteratively improve solutions based on both constraint satisfaction and objective performance.",
      "At each iteration, the LLM is provided with the current de- sign, the complete design history, and the iteration count (up to a maximum of 25 iterations). Based on the outcome of the FEM evaluation, an adaptive prompting strategy is employed: if the generated structure satisﬁes all constraints, an optimiza- tion prompt (msg_optim) directs the model to further minimize stress or improve structural eﬃciency; if the structure is infea- sible, a constraint-correction prompt (msg_constraint) instructs the LLM to analyze constraint violations and propose modiﬁca- tions. Throughout the process, the LLM leverages the FEM results and ranked history of prior designs to identify favorable patterns, correct past mistakes, and guide new generations. The model is explicitly tasked with autonomously terminating the optimization process once no further meaningful improvements are achievable."
