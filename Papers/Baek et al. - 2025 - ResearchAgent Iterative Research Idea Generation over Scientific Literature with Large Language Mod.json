  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop ResearchAgent, a system that leverages large language models to assist researchers in generating novel research ideas, including problem identification, method development, and experiment design, based on scientific literature. The authors aim to automate and iteratively refine the process of research ideation by integrating knowledge from academic graphs and entity-centric knowledge stores, and by incorporating feedback from LLM-powered reviewing agents aligned with human preferences.",
    "evidence": "To enhance the productivity of researchers, we propose ResearchAgent, which leverages the encyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist them in their work. This system automatically defines novel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively refining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing agents."

    "answer": "There is a lack of automated systems that can assist researchers in the ideation phase of scientific research by generating novel, valid, and clear research ideas based on the vast and rapidly growing scientific literature, especially in an open-ended manner that goes beyond simple hypothesis or link prediction.",
    "evidence": "However, this is a slow, effort-intensive process, which requires reading and synthesizing overwhelming amounts of knowledge over the vast corpus of rapidly growing scientific literature to formulate research ideas, as well as design and perform experimental validations of those ideas... However, LLMs have mainly been used for accelerating the experimental validation of already identified research ideas, but not for identifying new problems."
