  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to propose ResearchAgent, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist researchers in generating novel research ideas, methods, and experimental designs. The authors aim to enhance the productivity of researchers by automating the definition of novel problems and iteratively refining them based on feedback from LLM-powered reviewing agents.",
    "evidence": "To enhance the productivity of researchers, we propose ResearchAgent, which leverages the encyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist them in their work. This system automatically defines novel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively refining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing agents."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in leveraging LLMs for the first phase of scientific research, specifically idea generation, which involves conceptualizing novel research questions, methodologies, and experiments. Previous works have focused on accelerating the experimental validation process rather than identifying new problems.",
    "evidence": "A few recent papers in the domain of LLM-augmented scientific discovery have focused on the second phase. Specifically, they attempt to mainly accelerate the experimental validation process... Thus, in this paper, we leverage LLMs in the first phase of scientific research – specifically idea generation, whose key focus is conceptualizing novel research questions, methodologies, and experiments."
