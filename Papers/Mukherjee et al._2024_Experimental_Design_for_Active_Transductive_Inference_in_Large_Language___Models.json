  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop a framework for adaptive prompt design in large language models (LLMs) using active learning, termed Active In-context Prompt Design (AIPD). The authors aim to optimize the selection of few-shot examples from a training set to improve performance on a test set, thereby reducing uncertainty in LLM predictions.",
    "evidence": "In this work, we use active learning for adaptive prompt design and call it Active In-context Prompt Design (AIPD). We design the LLM prompt by adaptively choosing few-shot examples from a training set to optimize performance on a test set."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in optimal prompt design for LLMs, which has been largely focused on handcrafted prompts or clustering-based approaches, lacking a systematic method to balance uncertainty and diversity.",
    "evidence": "Prior works on prompt tuning mainly focus on hard prompts, which are carefully handcrafted to get the desired output. This can be time-consuming and fragile... Zhang et al. [2022a,b] and Diao et al. [2023] explored adaptive prompt design using clustering-based and uncertainty-reducing approaches. While these approaches offer some benefits, we argue that optimal designs can outperform them by effectively balancing uncertainty and diversity."
