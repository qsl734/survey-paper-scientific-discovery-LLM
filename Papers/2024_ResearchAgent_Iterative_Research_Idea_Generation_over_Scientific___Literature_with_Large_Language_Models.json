  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to propose ResearchAgent, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist researchers in generating novel research ideas, methods, and experiment designs. The authors aim to enhance the productivity of researchers by automating the ideation process and iteratively refining ideas based on feedback from LLM-powered reviewing agents.",
    "evidence": "To enhance the productivity of researchers, we propose ResearchAgent, which leverages the encyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist them in their work. This system automatically defines novel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively refining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing agents."

    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in leveraging LLMs for the first phase of scientific research, specifically idea generation, which has been less explored compared to the acceleration of experimental validation.",
