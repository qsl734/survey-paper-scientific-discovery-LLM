    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to design language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery by automating workflow planning based on high-level goals and scientist intuition. The authors aim to move beyond agents restricted to specific tasks within predefined workflows, enabling agents to independently plan, reason, and adapt workflows for scientific discovery. They propose a multi-agent framework, MAPPS, that unifies planning, physics, and scientist input to achieve this goal.",

      "To improve the autonomy of LLM agents for science, we aim to move beyond systems where agents act solely as tool executors within fixed, human-designed workflows. Instead, we propose a multi-agent framework MAPPS that achieves Level 2 autonomy by enabling agents to actively design and follow their own workflows.",
      "Specifically, our multi-agent framework integrates three core components, including Workflow Planner, Tool Code Generator, and Scientific Mediator. These three agents, coupled with human scientists, collaboratively drive materials discovery by planning tasks, generating code, and integrating expert guidance.",
      "This demonstrates that LLMs possess strong capabilities for understanding scientific concepts and facilitating materials discovery. Moreover, the results in Table 2 demonstrate that our MAPPS surpasses MatLLMSearch, a recent baseline that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms, on the Matbench dataset. This result highlights that LLMs are not merely useful for replacing individual components in an algorithmic pipeline but can serve as central reasoning engines for end-to-end scientific design.",
