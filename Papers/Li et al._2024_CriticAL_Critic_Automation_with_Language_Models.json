  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce CriticAL, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate the criticism of scientific models by generating summary statistics and applying hypothesis tests to evaluate their significance.",
    "evidence": "Motivated by this, we introduce CriticAL (Critic Automation with Language Models). CriticAL uses LLMs to generate summary statistics that capture discrepancies between model predictions and data, and applies hypothesis tests to evaluate their significance."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in automating model criticism, which is traditionally dependent on human expertise to compare models with data and evaluate discrepancies.",
    "evidence": "Automating model criticism is difficult because it traditionally requires a human expert to define how to compare a model with data and evaluate if the discrepancies are significant–both rely heavily on understanding the modeling assumptions and domain."
