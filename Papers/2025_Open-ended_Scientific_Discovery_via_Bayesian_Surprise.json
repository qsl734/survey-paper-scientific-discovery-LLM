    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in open-ended autonomous scientific discovery, where existing methods struggle to navigate the vast hypothesis space meaningfully and rely on subjective proxies for human interestingness.",
    "evidence": "The few existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the latter suffers from imprecise definitions."
