    "answer": "Current ASD systems largely explore variants of existing codebases or similarly constrained design spaces, and they produce large volumes of research artifacts that are typically evaluated using conference-style paper review with limited evaluation of code.",
    "evidence": "Despite the surge of interest in autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) of software artifacts (e.g., improved ML algorithms), current ASD systems face two key limitations: (1) they largely explore variants of existing codebases or similarly constrained design spaces, and (2) they produce large volumes of research artifacts (such as automatically generated papers and code) that are typically evaluated using conference-style paper review with limited evaluation of code."
