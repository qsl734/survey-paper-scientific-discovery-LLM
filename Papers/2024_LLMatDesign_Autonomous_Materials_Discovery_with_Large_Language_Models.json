  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce LLMatDesign, a novel language-based framework for interpretable materials design powered by large language models (LLMs). The authors aim to address the challenge of discovering new materials with user-defined target properties in the small data regime, leveraging LLMs to translate human instructions, apply modifications to materials, and evaluate outcomes.",

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "The knowledge gap addressed by the paper is the reliance of current data-driven materials discovery methods on extensive training datasets, which are often unavailable or costly to obtain. This limits the flexibility and chemical understanding required for effective materials discovery.",
    "evidence": "However, these data-driven methods rely heavily on extensive training datasets, generally derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These methods are less useful in most instances where such data is unavailable, or when only a limited budget exists to perform experiments or high fidelity simulations."
