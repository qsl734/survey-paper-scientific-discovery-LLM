  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop a novel framework for automated research idea generation using large language models that can dynamically balance and optimize for novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness. The authors aim to address the limitations of existing prompting-based approaches by introducing a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning and controllable reinforcement learning. The framework is designed to generate high-quality research ideas by navigating the inherent trade-offs among key evaluation metrics.",
    "evidence": "To address these limitations, we for the first time propose fine-tuning LLMs to be better idea proposers and introduce a novel framework that employs a two-stage approach combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and controllable Reinforcement Learning (RL). ... Our framework provides a balanced approach to research ideation, achieving high-quality outcomes by dynamically navigating the trade-offs among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing automated research idea generation systems predominantly rely on prompting-based pre-trained models, which limits their ability to optimize generated content and handle the complex interdependence and trade-offs among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness in research ideation.",
    "evidence": "However, current approaches predominantly rely on prompting-based pre-trained models, limiting their ability to optimize generated content effectively. Moreover, they also lack the capability to deal with the complex interdependence and inherent restrictions among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness, which remains challenging due to the inherent trade-offs among these dimensions, such as the innovation-feasibility conflict."
