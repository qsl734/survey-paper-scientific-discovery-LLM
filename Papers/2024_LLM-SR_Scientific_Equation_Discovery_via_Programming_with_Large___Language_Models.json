    "answer": "- Cranmer (2023) PySR inspired the multi-island asynchronous evolution approach used in LLM-SR. (Methodological precursors)\n- Udrescu & Tegmark (2020) The Feynman benchmark problems highlighted the need for custom benchmarks to prevent LLM recitation. (Experimental baselines)",
    "evidence": "Most of the traditional symbolic regression techniques are built on top of Genetic Programming (GP) evolutionary methods, representing mathematical equations as expression trees and searching the combinatorial space of possible equations through iterative mutation and recombination. However, these methods often struggle with the complexity of the vast optimization space and do not incorporate prior scientific knowledge, which leads to suboptimal solutions and inefficient exploration of the equation search space."
