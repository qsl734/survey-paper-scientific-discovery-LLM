    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled and scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. The authors aim to overcome the limitations of large language models in generating novel and relevant ideas without relying on handcrafted rules or extensive prompt engineering. The framework is designed to be adaptable across different domains, input formats, and creative tasks.",
    "evidence": "In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains, input formats, and creative tasks."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing large language models struggle to generate truly original or imaginative outputs, often replicating familiar patterns from their training data, and current creativity enhancement methods rely on brittle, domain-specific heuristics that are difficult to generalize.",
    "evidence": "LLMs often struggle to generate truly original or imaginative outputs. Because they are trained on vast repositories of existing data, LLMs tend to follow familiar patterns, leading to repetitive or “safe” ideas that lack genuine novelty (Mizrahi et al., 2025). ... Such heuristic-seeding approaches—though effective—illustrate the cost of hand-tailoring rules and representations for each domain to unlock higher-level creativity."
