    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce MatExpert, a novel framework that leverages large language models and contrastive learning to accelerate the discovery and design of new solid-state materials. The authors aim to mimic the workflow of human materials design experts by integrating retrieval, transition, and generation stages in the material discovery process. They seek to address limitations in current AI-driven material generation methods by enabling iterative refinement and reasoning for more accurate and interpretable material designs.",
    "evidence": "In this work, we introduce MatExpert, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and contrastive learning to accelerate the discovery and design of new solid-state materials. Inspired by the workflow of human materials design experts, our approach integrates three key stages: retrieval, transition, and generation."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Current AI models for material generation lack the ability to iteratively refine and optimize material structures based on intermediate feedback and struggle to integrate multimodal data, limiting their ability to replicate the complex, reasoning-driven processes employed by human experts.",
    "evidence": "Most approaches generate material structures in a single step, often resulting in static outputs that lack the flexibility for iterative refinement and optimization based on intermediate feedback. Moreover, these models struggle to integrate multimodal data—such as textual descriptions of desired properties and structural information like atomic coordinates from Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs)—in a meaningful and cohesive way. Consequently, they fall short of replicating the complex, reasoning-driven processes employed by human experts, limiting their ability to generate materials that meet specific target properties."
