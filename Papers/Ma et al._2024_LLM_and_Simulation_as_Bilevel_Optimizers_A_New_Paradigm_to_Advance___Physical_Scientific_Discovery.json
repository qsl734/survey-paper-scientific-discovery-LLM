    "answer": "- Wang et al. (2023) Their work on automating scientific discovery inspired the framework's design. (Methodological precursors)\n- Popper (2005) The iterative hypothesis and observation approach was inspired by Popper's philosophy. (Methodological precursors)\n- Wuestman et al. (2020) The aggressive exploration of novel ideas was inspired by their typology of scientific breakthroughs. (Methodological precursors)",
    "evidence": "In physical science, spanning physics, chemistry, pharmacology, etc., various research streams aim to automate and speed up scientific discovery (Wang et al., 2023). Each stream innovates within its field, creating methods tailored to its specific challenges and nuances. However, this approach often misses a universally applicable philosophy (Popper, 2005; Fortunato et al., 2018)... exploit the existing knowledge while occasionally explore novel ideas aggressively in pursuits of breakthrough (Wuestman et al., 2020)."
