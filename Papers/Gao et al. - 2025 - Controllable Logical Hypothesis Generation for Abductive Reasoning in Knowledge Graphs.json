  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce and address the task of controllable abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs, enabling the generation of logical hypotheses that are both plausible explanations for observations and adhere to user-specified semantic and structural constraints. The authors aim to overcome challenges such as hypothesis space collapse and oversensitivity when generating complex logical hypotheses. They propose a new framework, CtrlHGen, to improve the controllability and practical utility of abductive reasoning in large-scale knowledge graphs.",
    "evidence": "To address this limitation, we introduce the task of controllable hypothesis generation to improve the practical utility of abductive reasoning. ... we propose CtrlHGen, a Controllable logcial Hypothesis Generation framework for abductive reasoning over knowledge graphs, trained in a two-stage paradigm including supervised learning and subsequent reinforcement learning."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing abductive reasoning methods for knowledge graphs lack controllability, resulting in the generation of numerous plausible but redundant or irrelevant hypotheses, especially in large-scale graphs, and do not allow for user-specified semantic or structural constraints.",
    "evidence": "However, due to a lack of controllability, a single observation may yield numerous plausible but redundant or irrelevant hypotheses on large-scale knowledge graphs. ... Unfortunately, prior work [12] has largely overlooked controllable generation, resulting in hypotheses that are redundant or lack meaningful relevance."
