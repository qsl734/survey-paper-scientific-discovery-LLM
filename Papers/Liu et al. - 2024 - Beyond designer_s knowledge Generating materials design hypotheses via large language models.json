  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to demonstrate that large language models, when combined with prompt engineering and materials system charts, can autonomously generate non-trivial and innovative materials design hypotheses that integrate scientific principles from diverse sources, without explicit human expert guidance. The authors aim to show that this approach can produce valuable, realizable ideas beyond the current knowledge of individual researchers, as validated by recent high-impact experimental publications. The work focuses on generating hypotheses for high-entropy alloys with superior cryogenic properties and halide solid electrolytes with enhanced ionic conductivity and formability.",
