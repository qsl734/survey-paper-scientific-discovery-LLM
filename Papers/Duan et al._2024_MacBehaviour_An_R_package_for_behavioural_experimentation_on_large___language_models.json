    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop an R package called 'MacBehaviour' that facilitates behavioural experimentation on large language models (LLMs) by providing a comprehensive set of functions for experiment design, stimuli presentation, model behaviour manipulation, and logging responses.",

    "answer": "The paper addresses the lack of standard procedures for studying machine behaviour, which makes it difficult to compare results or build on previous research, limiting our collective grasp of LLM behaviour.",
