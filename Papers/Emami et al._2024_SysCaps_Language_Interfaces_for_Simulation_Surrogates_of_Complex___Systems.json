  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce language interfaces, called SysCaps, for surrogate models of complex energy systems to make them more accessible and improve their accuracy and generalization abilities.",
    "evidence": "Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call 'system captions' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts."
