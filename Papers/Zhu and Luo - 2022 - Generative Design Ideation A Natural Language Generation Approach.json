    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to explore a generative approach for knowledge-based design ideation by applying pre-trained language models, specifically fine-tuning a generative pre-trained transformer using the United States Patent and Trademark Office patent database. The authors aim to generate concise and understandable design ideas that synthesize target designs with external knowledge sources, with controllable knowledge distance. The method is tested in a case study of rolling toy design to evaluate its performance in generating ideas of varied novelty.",
    "evidence": "This paper aims to explore a generative approach for knowledge-based design ideation by applying the latest pre-trained language models in artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, a method of fine-tuning the generative pre-trained transformer using the USPTO patent database is proposed. The AI-generated ideas are not only in concise and understandable language but also able to synthesize the target design with external knowledge sources with controllable knowledge distance. The method is tested in a case study of rolling toy design and the results show good performance in generating ideas of varied novelty with near-field and far-field source knowledge."
