    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce a comprehensive mathematical framework for the automated, objective evaluation and selection of ideas generated by conversational artificial intelligence systems or humans during the ideation phase of product design. The authors aim to address the challenge of qualitative assessment of large pools of ideas, which is traditionally reliant on subjective human evaluation, by providing a scalable, quantitative, and unbiased method. The framework leverages high-dimensional vector embeddings and clustering techniques to measure diversity and select promising ideas.",
    "evidence": "Addressing this gap, our study introduces a comprehensive mathematical framework for automated analysis to objectively evaluate the plethora of ideas generated by CAI systems and/or humans. This framework is particularly advantageous for novice designers who lack experience in selecting promising ideas. By converting the ideas into higher dimensional vectors and quantitatively measuring the diversity between them using tools such as UMAP, DBSCAN and PCA, the proposed method provides a reliable and objective way of selecting the most promising ideas, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the ideation phase."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "There is a lack of objective, scalable, and systematic methods for evaluating and characterizing the distribution and quality of large pools of ideas generated during the ideation phase, especially those produced by conversational artificial intelligence systems, as current approaches rely heavily on subjective human judgment which is labor-intensive, inconsistent, and prone to bias.",
    "evidence": "Despite the success in ideation quantity, the qualitative assessment of these ideas remains challenging and traditionally reliant on expert human evaluation. This method suffers from limitations such as human judgment errors, bias, and oversight. ... However, there is no work available in the literature that enables an objective measure of the distribution of ideas in the idea space for characterizing the quality of an ideation exercise."

      "The literature highlights that evaluators often prematurely apply criteria such as feasibility, usefulness, or practicality during the early stages of idea assessment. For instance, using assessment methods like the Pugh Chart, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) Matrix, or the Novelty, Usefulness, and Feasibility (NUF) test can lead evaluators to discard potentially valuable creative ideas simply because they appear initially impractical or less useful without sufficient elaboration or development (Kudrowitz and Wallace 2013).",
      "LLM-based evaluations typically depend on carefully crafting input prompts and are sensitive to the phrasing and elaboration level of idea descriptions, thus affecting their reliability and generalizability (Organisciak et al. 2023; Claire Stevenson et al. 2022). Such models also lack transparency in decision-making, often limiting interpretability, reproducibility and justification for why a specific score was assigned to an idea."
