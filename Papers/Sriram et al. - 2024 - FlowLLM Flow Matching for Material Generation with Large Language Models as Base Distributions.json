    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce FlowLLM, a novel generative model that combines large language models and Riemannian flow matching to design novel crystalline materials. The authors aim to significantly improve the generation rate of stable, unique, and novel crystalline materials compared to existing methods. They also seek to generate crystals that are much closer to their relaxed state, thereby reducing post-hoc computational costs.",
    "evidence": "In this paper, we introduce FlowLLM, a novel generative model that combines large language models (LLMs) and Riemannian flow matching (RFM) to design novel crystalline materials. ... Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing the generation rate of stable materials by over three times and increasing the rate for stable, unique, and novel crystals by ∼50% – a huge improvement on a difficult problem. Additionally, the crystals generated by FlowLLM are much closer to their relaxed state when compared with another leading model, significantly reducing post-hoc computational cost."

    "answer": "Existing generative models for crystalline materials struggle to simultaneously handle both discrete (atomic types) and continuous (atomic positions and lattice geometry) variables, and either lack the ability to model continuous values effectively or cannot leverage natural language prompting and prior chemical knowledge.",
    "evidence": "Generating crystalline materials is particularly challenging as it involves simultaneously generating both discrete (atomic types) and continuous values (atomic positions and lattice geometry). While existing approaches, namely autoregressive large language models (LLMs)[11, 6] and denoising models, e.g., denoising diffusion and flow matching [47, 16, 49, 48, 30, 26, 17], have demonstrated success, they exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. LLMs excel at modeling discrete values, but they can struggle with continuous values due to their reliance on finite precision representations. Conversely, denoising models more effectively handle continuous values and can easily ensure equivariances, but they face challenges with discrete elements."

      "We offer two interpretations for the effectiveness of our approach. 1) The LLM learns a good base distribution for RFM: the LLM’s output distribution serves as a learned base distribution for RFM, replacing the common practice of using the uniform base distribution. Since the LLM has been trained on material data, this learned base distribution is closer to the target distribution, greatly simplifying integration with RFM.",
      "Our experiments demonstrate that FlowLLM generates stable materials at over 300% higher rate, and S.U.N. materials at ∼50% higher rate compared to prior models, while retaining the LLM’s ability to be prompted with natural language instructions."
