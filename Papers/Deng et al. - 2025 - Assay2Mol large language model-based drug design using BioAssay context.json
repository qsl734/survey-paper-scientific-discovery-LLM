  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that leverages unstructured BioAssay records to generate candidate drug-like molecules for early-stage drug discovery. The authors aim to enable molecule generation for targets without requiring protein structures or sequences by utilizing text and experimental data from public biochemical screening assays. They seek to outperform existing machine learning approaches in generating relevant, synthesizable molecules for specified biological activities.",
    "evidence": "We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "There is a lack of computational workflows that can efficiently leverage the vast, unstructured text and experimental data in public BioAssay repositories to guide drug-like molecule generation for arbitrary targets, especially when protein structures or sequences are unavailable.",
    "evidence": "Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. Sorting through these repositories for the data pertinent to an arbitrary target is a daunting task. Scientists need workflows that can rapidly identify relevant BioAssay records based on their associated text, extract key textual and tabular chemical testing data comprising molecule structures paired with experimental activity outcomes, and apply this information to models capable of learning structure-activity relationships to recommend new molecules for testing."

Summarization of BioAssay findings ... 2. Presentation of tabular experimental data ... 3. Molecule selection ... Of particular interest are counterscreens, which are designed to detect false positives such as pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) ... Therefore, we use the LLM to summarize the retrieved BioAssays and identify whether the BioAssay record represents a counterscreen assay."

      "Metric. We use Vina Dock (Eberhardt et al., 2021) to score the binding complementarity of a molecule, or the strength of interaction, with a protein target. High Affinity indicates the percentage of generated molecules that outperform the reference molecules in Vina Dock. Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is a metric that combines multiple molecular properties (e.g., molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors) into a single value between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating more drug-like compounds (Bickerton et al., 2012). Synthetic Accessibility (SA) score estimates synthetic feasibility based on fragment contributions observed in known molecules and structural complexity penalties (Ertl and Schuffenhauer, 2009). We use the normalized SA score between 0 and 1, where 0 is most difficult to synthesize. QED and SA are computed with RDKit (Landrum, 2016). Diversity is quantified as the average pairwise Tanimoto distance between Morgan fingerprint of the generated molecules. The Vina score is correlated with the number of atoms in the molecule (Weller and Rohs, 2024), so we also track the Molecule Size as the number of heavy atoms."
