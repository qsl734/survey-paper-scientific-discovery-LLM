  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to propose ResearchAgent, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist researchers in generating novel research ideas, including problem identification, method development, and experiment design, by integrating knowledge from scientific literature and iterative feedback from LLM-powered reviewing agents.",
    "evidence": "To enhance the productivity of researchers, we propose ResearchAgent, which leverages the encyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist them in their work. This system automatically defines novel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively refining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing agents."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in leveraging LLMs for the first phase of scientific research, specifically idea generation, as previous works have focused mainly on accelerating the experimental validation process.",
    "evidence": "A few recent papers in the domain of LLM-augmented scientific discovery have focused on the second phase. Specifically, they attempt to mainly accelerate the experimental validation process... Thus, in this paper, we leverage LLMs in the first phase of scientific research – specifically idea generation."

    "evidence": [
      "To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to leverage and evaluate the capabilities of LLMs to act as mediators in scientific idea generation in an open-ended setting.",
      "We model each of these three aspects in our ResearchAgent. Specifically, in order to imbibe related work, the system begins with a core scientific paper and then explores a range of related papers through references and citation relationships.",
      "Crucially, these ReviewingAgents are prompted with evaluation criteria that are induced from real researchers’ judgments, thus aligning them with actual scientific preferential standards.",
      "We draw distinctions between three key components of their workflow: a broad and deep understanding of related scientific literature, an encyclopedic view of concepts and how they relate to one another both within and across domains, and a community of colleagues on which to rely for feedback and constructive criticism."
