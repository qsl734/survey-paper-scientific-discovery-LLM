(1) takes a set of papers as input and finds a set of analogous papers, (2) extracts key facets from the input and analogous papers, (3) recombines those facets into new ideas, (4) evaluates those ideas for novelty, (5) iterates upon those ideas to improve their novelty, and (6) allows seamless human refinement at each step.",
