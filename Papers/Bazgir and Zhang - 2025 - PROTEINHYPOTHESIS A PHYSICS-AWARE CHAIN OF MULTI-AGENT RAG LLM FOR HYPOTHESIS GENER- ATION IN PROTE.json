    "answer": "Traditional hypothesis generation in molecular biology and protein science is limited by human cognitive constraints, the exponential growth of scientific literature, and the complexity of interdisciplinary research, making manual synthesis of vast information and identification of research gaps increasingly impractical.",
    "evidence": "While these conventional approaches have led to groundbreaking discoveries, they are increasingly constrained by the limitations of human cognition, the exponential growth of scientific literature, and the rising complexity of interdisciplinary research. Scientists today face significant challenges in synthesizing vast amounts of information, identifying meaningful research gaps, and formulating hypotheses that integrate insights from multiple fields (Chai et al., 2024) (Abdel-Rehim et al., 2024). The limitations of traditional hypothesis generation methods are particularly evident in data-intensive disciplines such as biomedicine, astronomy, and computational sciences, where vast datasets and complex relationships make manual exploration impractical (Tong et al., 2024) (Ishikawa, 2024)."
