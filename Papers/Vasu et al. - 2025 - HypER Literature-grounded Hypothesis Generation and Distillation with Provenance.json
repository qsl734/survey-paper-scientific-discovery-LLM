  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop HypER, a small language model trained for literature-guided reasoning and evidence-based hypothesis generation. The authors aim to train a model that can organize and reason over scientific literature, distinguishing valid from invalid reasoning chains, and generate well-grounded scientific hypotheses, particularly in the medical domain. They seek to bridge the gap between traditional literature-based discovery and large language model-based hypothesis generation by explicitly validating reasoning chains using relevance scoring.",
    "evidence": "We present HypER (Hypothesis Generation with Explanation and Reasoning), a small language model (SLM) trained for literature-guided reasoning and evidence-based hypothesis generation. ... we argue that scientific AI assistants should be trained to organize and reason over the literature, mimicking real-world scientific inquiry. In this paper, we ask: How can we train an LLM to navigate the noisy literature and generate novel and impactful ideas that are grounded in a solid understanding of existing work."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing large language model-based approaches to scientific hypothesis generation lack a structured approach to literature organization and do not validate the logical coherence of reasoning chains, often resulting in ungrounded or uninterpretable hypotheses. There is a need for models that can provide clear provenance and logical progression of ideas, especially in evidence-driven domains like medicine.",
    "evidence": "Existing LLM-based approaches to scientific hypothesis generation, such as ResearchAgent (Baek et al., 2024a), Acceleron (Nigam et al., 2024), SciMuse (Gu and Krenn, 2024), and SciMON (Wang et al., 2023b) treat the task as conditional generation over retrieved literature. Unlike traditional LBD systems, these models lack a structured approach to literature organization. ... this flexibility often comes at the cost of interpretability and grounding in scientific evidence, two attributes essential for real-world use in clinical and biomedical research."
