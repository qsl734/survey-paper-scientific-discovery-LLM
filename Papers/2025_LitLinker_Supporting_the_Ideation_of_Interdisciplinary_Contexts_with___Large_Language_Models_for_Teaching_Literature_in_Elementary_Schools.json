    "evidence": "Inspired by [27, 58], LitLinker aligns its behavior with teachers’ habitual practices in interdisciplinary ideation (DP1). We designed an LLM-based multi-agent system to simulate human collaboration. Following the multi-agent collaborative framework by Hong et al. [26], we decompose the task into multiple steps, allowing agents to use tools when necessary and interact with the user for feedback. The effectiveness of the content generated through this architecture relies on a comprehensive Context Pool (DP4) and carefully designed prompts (DP2, DP3), which will be introduced in Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.2.3, respectively."
