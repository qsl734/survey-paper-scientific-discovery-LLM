    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop a method for open-ended autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) that uses Bayesian surprise to guide exploration and hypothesis generation, aiming to outperform existing methods in producing surprising discoveries.",

    "answer": "There is a lack of effective methods for open-ended autonomous scientific discovery that can efficiently explore the vast hypothesis space and produce surprising discoveries.",
    "evidence": "The few existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the latter suffers from imprecise definitions."
