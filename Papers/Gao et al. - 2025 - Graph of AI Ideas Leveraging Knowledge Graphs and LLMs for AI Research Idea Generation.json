    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to propose a framework called Graph of AI Ideas (GoAI) that leverages knowledge graphs and large language models to generate novel, clear, and effective research ideas in the field of artificial intelligence. The authors aim to address the challenges posed by the rapid growth of research literature and complex citation relationships, which hinder efficient analysis of research trends and idea generation.",
    "evidence": "Inspired by knowledge graphs and human cognitive processes, we propose a framework called the Graph of AI Ideas (GoAI) for the AI research field, which is dominated by open-access papers. This framework organizes relevant literature into entities within a knowledge graph and summarizes the semantic information contained in citations into relations within the graph. ... Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating novel, clear, and effective research ideas."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing methods for generating research ideas using large language models do not fully exploit the semantic information embedded in citation relationships, often oversimplify research trend summaries, and lack objective evaluation mechanisms for the generated ideas.",

Existing methods for generating research ideas using LLMs typically rely on human evaluation and prompt-based assessments, lacking an objective evaluation mechanism for assessing, providing feedback, and refining the generated ideas."
