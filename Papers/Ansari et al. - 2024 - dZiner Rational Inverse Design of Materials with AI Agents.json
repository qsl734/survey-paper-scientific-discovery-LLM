    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to present dZiner, an AI agent powered by large language models, for the rational inverse design of materials with desired properties. The authors aim to enable efficient discovery of new compounds by integrating domain-specific knowledge from scientific literature, surrogate models, and human feedback into an iterative design process. The framework is demonstrated across various materials design tasks, including surfactants, drug candidates, and metal-organic frameworks.",
    "evidence": "In this work, we present dZiner, a chemist AI agent, powered by large language models (LLMs), that discovers new compounds with desired properties via inverse design (property-to-structure). In specific, the agent leverages domain-specific insights from foundational scientific literature to propose new materials with enhanced chemical properties, iteratively evaluating them using relevant surrogate models in a rational design process, while accounting for design constraints."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "There is a lack of frameworks that can efficiently integrate structured experimental data, chemical domain knowledge, and context from scientific literature into data-driven workflows for materials discovery, especially when large training datasets are unavailable or experimental budgets are limited.",
    "evidence": "Despite the wealth of existing scientific literature, the availability of both structured experimental data and chemical domain knowledge that can be easily integrated into data-driven workflows is limited. ... However, these models face challenges when such data is unavailable or when there is only a limited budget for conducting experiments or simulations. In contrast, a human expert would be much more effective in such cases, by leveraging their domain knowledge and reasoning from limited examples. This underscores the need for a new materials design paradigm, where models are built to replicate and/or integrate the expertise of human domain experts."
