  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in fully automating the entire proteomics research process, which is traditionally reliant on human experts and prone to biases and inefficiencies.",
    "evidence": "Current proteomics research relies heavily on human experts to design and perform data analysis using professional methods and tools, making decisions ranging from specific data manipulation to general research directions. This process brings forward two main issues. First, analysis can be extremely time-consuming, especially when it involves trial-and-error over large sets of possible proteins or sample groups. Second, the researcher’s personal knowledge and habits may bias experimental design, potentially impeding comprehensive analysis and limiting its overall scope."
