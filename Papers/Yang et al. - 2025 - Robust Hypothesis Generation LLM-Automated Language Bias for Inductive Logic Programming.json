  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop a novel framework that automates robust hypothesis generation in open environments by integrating a multi-agent system powered by large language models with inductive logic programming. The authors aim to enable automatic construction of symbolic language bias (predicate systems) from raw textual data, overcoming the traditional reliance on expert-defined predicates in inductive logic programming. The framework is designed to generate verifiable, interpretable, and robust hypotheses from unstructured text.",
    "evidence": "We introduce a novel framework integrating a multi-agent system, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), with Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Our system’s LLM agents autonomously define a structured symbolic vocabulary (predicates) and relational templates , i.e., language bias directly from raw textual data. ... This approach overcomes traditional ILP’s reliance on predefined symbolic structures and the noise-sensitivity of pure LLM methods."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Traditional inductive logic programming methods depend heavily on expert-crafted predicate systems, which limits scalability and adaptability in complex or open-domain tasks, and there is a lack of research on automating the construction of these predicate spaces.",
    "evidence": "This reliance on expert-crafted predicates, however, poses significant challenges in complex domains. ... Meanwhile, current ILP research has focused primarily on optimizing rule search algorithms[4], rarely exploring the automatic construction of predicate spaces, which severely limits its scalability in open-domain tasks."
