    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to evaluate the research ideation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and determine if they can generate novel ideas comparable to those of expert humans.",

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "There is a lack of evaluation on whether LLMs can generate novel, expert-level research ideas, which is a critical step in the scientific research process.",

    "evidence": "Evaluating expert-level capabilities of LLM systems is challenging (Bakhtin et al., 2022, Collins et al., 2024), and research ideation takes this to an extreme. Qualified expert researchers are difficult to recruit at scale, evaluation criteria can be highly subjective, and it is difficult for even the best experts to judge the quality of an idea (Beygelzimer et al., 2021, Simsek et al., 2024)."
