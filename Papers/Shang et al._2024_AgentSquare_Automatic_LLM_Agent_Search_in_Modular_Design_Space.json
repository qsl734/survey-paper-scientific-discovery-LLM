  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce a novel research problem called Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS) and propose a framework named AgentSquare to optimize LLM agent designs by leveraging a modular design space.",
    "evidence": "In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory."

    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in current research where LLM agent designs are predominantly manual and task-specific, limiting adaptability to novel tasks.",
    "evidence": "However, current research predominantly relies on manually designed agentic systems tailored for specific tasks, which often depend heavily on expert insight and intensive human labor. Furthermore, these task-specific agent designs frequently struggle to adapt to novel tasks."
