    "answer": "There is a lack of systematic, unbiased, and scalable methods for generating plausible scientific hypotheses from complex mass spectrometry data in astrobiology, particularly methods that can integrate prior literature and overcome human bias and data complexity.",
    "evidence": "Hypothesis generation from mass spectrometry data is challenging due to factors such as environmental contaminants, the complexity of spectral peaks, and difficulties in cross-matching these peaks with prior studies. ... Hypothesis generation by human experts is often biased, time-consuming, and limited to the literature that the individual has expertise in. Computational methods, on the other hand, are challenged by the sparsity of peaks relevant to the dimension of the mass spectrometry data, which makes identifying patterns extremely difficult."

Among the 101 hypotheses generated by Gemini 2.0 Flash, 36 were determined to be plausible by the expert, and of these, 24 were flagged as novel.
