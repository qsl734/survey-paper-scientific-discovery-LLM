  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop and demonstrate SciAgents, a multi-agent artificial intelligence framework that autonomously generates and refines scientific research hypotheses by leveraging large language models and ontological knowledge graphs. The authors aim to automate and accelerate the scientific discovery process, particularly in the domain of bio-inspired materials, by enabling the system to explore novel interdisciplinary relationships and generate innovative research ideas. The framework is designed to surpass traditional human-driven research methods in scale, precision, and exploratory power.",
    "evidence": "In this work, we present SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. ... The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Traditional human-driven scientific discovery is limited by the researcher's background knowledge and is inadequate for exploring the vast, interdisciplinary scientific data required for novel discoveries, especially in multi-disciplinary fields like bio-inspired materials. There is a lack of automated systems capable of synthesizing and reasoning over large, interconnected scientific knowledge bases to generate new, high-impact hypotheses.",
    "evidence": "While these conventional approaches have led to breakthroughs throughout the history of science, they are constrained by the researcher’s ingenuity and background knowledge, potentially limiting discovery to the bounds of human imagination. Additionally, conventional human-driven methods are inadequate for exploring the vast amount of existing scientific data to extrapolate knowledge toward entirely novel ideas specially for multi-disciplinary areas like bio-inspired materials design where a common goal is to extract principles from Nature’s toolbox and bring it to bear towards engineering applications."
