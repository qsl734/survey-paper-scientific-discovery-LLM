    "answer": "There is a lack of methodologies that enable the open-ended evolution and refinement of symbolic solutions, particularly approaches that can leverage both existing and newly generated knowledge to guide the search in complex symbolic representation spaces.",
    "evidence": "Despite these insights, no existing studies explicitly tackle the challenge of open-ended evolution and refinement of symbolic solutions. The primary obstacles hindering progress in this area are two-fold: 1) the difficulties of conducting efficient searches on the symbolic representation spaces, which are often NP-hard across multiple domains [26], and more crucially, 2) the absence of methodologies for leveraging existing knowledge and newly generated knowledge to guide the search."
