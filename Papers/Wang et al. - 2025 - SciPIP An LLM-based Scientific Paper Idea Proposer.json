  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce SciPIP, a novel framework that enhances large language model-based scientific idea proposal by improving both literature retrieval and idea generation. The authors aim to address the shortcomings of existing approaches that rely on keyword-based retrieval and limited use of full-text insights. SciPIP is designed to generate more innovative, feasible, and valuable scientific ideas by leveraging a comprehensive literature database and a dual-path idea generation process.",
    "evidence": "To address these limitations, we introduce SciPIP, an innovative framework designed to enhance the LLM-based proposal of scientific ideas through improvements in both literature retrieval and idea generation. ... Our experiments, conducted across various domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrate SciPIP’s capability to generate a multitude of innovative and useful ideas."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing scientific idea generation approaches are limited by their reliance on keyword-based literature retrieval, which neglects semantic information and often results in incomplete retrieval, and by depending solely on the internal knowledge of large language models or paper metadata, thus overlooking valuable insights from full texts.",
    "evidence": "However, existing approaches often fall short due to their reliance on keyword-based search tools during the retrieval phase, which neglects crucial semantic information and frequently results in incomplete retrieval outcomes. Similarly, in the idea generation phase, current methodologies tend to depend solely on the internal knowledge of LLMs or metadata from retrieved papers, thereby overlooking significant valuable insights contained within the full texts."
