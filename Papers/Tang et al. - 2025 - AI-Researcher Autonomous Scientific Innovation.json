  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "There is a lack of fully autonomous scientific research systems capable of original innovation, as existing agentic frameworks are limited to narrow task automation and cannot orchestrate the complete research workflow or systematically explore solution spaces beyond human cognitive limitations.",
    "evidence": "Despite recent advances in agentic frameworks powered by LLMs, scientific innovation represents an intellectual frontier orders of magnitude more challenging than the task automation currently mastered by existing AI agents [4–7]. ... These profound limitations have prevented AI systems from autonomously conducting meaningful scientific work, perpetuating a paradigm where AI remains relegated to narrow assistance roles rather than functioning as independent scientific contributors capable of accelerating human knowledge advancement through systematic exploration of solution spaces beyond human cognitive limitations."
