  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to investigate whether augmenting large language models with relevant data during the research idea generation process can enhance the quality of generated ideas in the social sciences. The authors aim to address challenges related to feasibility and expected effectiveness of large language model-generated research ideas by incorporating metadata and automatic validation. They conduct empirical experiments in the domain of climate negotiations to evaluate the impact of these data-driven enhancements.",
    "evidence": "This paper explores how augmenting LLMs with relevant data during the idea generation process can enhance the quality of generated ideas. We introduce two ways of incorporating data: (1) providing metadata during the idea generation stage to guide LLMs toward feasible directions, and (2) adding automatic validation during the idea selection stage to assess the empirical plausibility of hypotheses within ideas. We conduct experiments in the social science domain, specifically with climate negotiation topics, and find that metadata improves the feasibility of generated ideas by 20%, while automatic validation improves the overall quality of selected ideas by 7%."

    "answer": "Many research ideas generated by large language models are novel but often lack feasibility, suitable datasets for validation, or have uncertain effectiveness, limiting their practical utility in empirical research.",
    "evidence": "However, many LLM-generated ideas suffer from practical limitations: they may be infeasible to implement, lack suitable datasets for validation, or have uncertain effectiveness. For instance, an LLM might propose investigating 'the impact of diplomats’ childhood environmental experiences on their bargaining positions in UN climate negotiations', which is an interesting idea but lacks available data for empirical analysis."
