    "evidence": "In this study, we present a novel structural framework for research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers."

  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in large language models' ability to guide users toward practical research ideas due to their limitations in domain-specific reasoning and grounding in real-time, trusted external sources.",
    "evidence": "However, despite their capabilities, large language models (LLMs) exhibit notable limitations when applied to scientific research ideation and other involved tasks. Most LLMs are trained broadly across a wide array of internet text, making them effective for general understanding that is often too shallow for domain-specific reasoning."

While 'The AI Scientist' automates peer review by focusing on 500 papers from the ICLR conference, our approach is more comprehensive, utilizing papers from nine different ML conferences.\nAnother recent example of a research agent is 'Scideator,' a RAG and Semantic Scholar-powered tool for recombining multiple facets of papers in literature."
