    "answer": "The paper addresses the challenge of LLMs being exposed to extensive literature without effective organization, which can lead to ideas lacking logical coherence and innovation.",
    "evidence": "However, in existing attempts, LLMs are presented with an extensive volume of research literature when asked to generate ideas. This makes LLMs vulnerable to the influence of less relevant works, potentially resulting in ideas that lack logical coherence and technological innovation."
