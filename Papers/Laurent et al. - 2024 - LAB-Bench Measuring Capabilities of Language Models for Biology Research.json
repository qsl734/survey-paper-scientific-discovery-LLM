    "answer": "There is a lack of benchmarks designed to evaluate language model performance on practical tasks required for scientific research, as existing benchmarks focus on 'textbook'-style questions.",
    "evidence": "However, most existing benchmarks for science are designed to test the ability to recall rote knowledge and answer 'textbook'-style questions, rather than assess the capacity for carrying out practical tasks in any specific domain."
