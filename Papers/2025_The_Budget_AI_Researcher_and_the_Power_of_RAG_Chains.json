  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to present a novel structural framework for research ideation using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from machine learning papers. The authors aim to improve the concreteness and interestingness of generated research ideas compared to standard prompting approaches.",
    "evidence": "In this study, we present a novel structural framework for research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "The paper addresses the gap in current large language models (LLMs) which, despite their capabilities, fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their limitations in domain-specific reasoning and lack of grounding in real-time, trusted external sources.",
    "evidence": "However, despite their capabilities, large language models (LLMs) exhibit notable limitations when applied to scientific research ideation and other involved tasks. Most LLMs are trained broadly across a wide array of internet text, making them effective for general understanding that is often too shallow for domain-specific reasoning."

    "evidence": "A prominent example of a related large language model (LLM) agent designed to accelerate machine learning research is 'The AI Scientist.' While 'The AI Scientist' automates peer review by focusing on 500 papers from the ICLR conference, our approach is more comprehensive, utilizing papers from nine different ML conferences. Another recent example of a research agent is 'Scideator,' a RAG and Semantic Scholar-powered tool for recombining multiple facets of papers in literature."
