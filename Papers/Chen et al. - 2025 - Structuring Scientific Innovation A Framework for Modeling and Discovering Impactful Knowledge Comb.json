  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to propose a structured framework for scientific discovery that systematically identifies and integrates problem-method combinations, rather than relying solely on large language model-generated research ideas. The authors aim to quantitatively assess the disruptive potential of new scientific discoveries using a disruptive index, and to develop a reasoning-guided search algorithm for discovering impactful knowledge recombinations. The framework is empirically validated across multiple scientific domains to demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling innovation dynamics and identifying high-impact discoveries.",
    "evidence": "Rather than viewing scientific discovery as isolated ideas or content, we propose a structured approach that emphasizes the role of method combinations in shaping disruptive insights. Specifically, we investigate how knowledge units—especially those tied to methodological design—can be modeled and recombined to yield research breakthroughs. ... Our proposed framework addresses two key challenges. First, we introduce a contrastive learning-based mechanism to identify distinguishing features of historically disruptive method combinations within problem-driven contexts. Second, we propose a reasoning-guided Monte Carlo search algorithm that leverages the chain-of-thought capability of LLMs to identify promising knowledge recombinations for new problem statements."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing approaches to scientific discovery with large language models lack systematic identification and integration of fine-grained knowledge components, resulting in macro-level idea generation rather than precise problem-method matching, and lack objective metrics to assess the transformative impact of discoveries.",
    "evidence": "However, despite these advancements, existing approaches still exhibit several limitations: (1) the inability to systematically identify and integrate fine-grained knowledge components, resulting in scientific discovery that remains at a macro-level of idea generation rather than precise matching of research problems and methods; ... and (3) the absence of objective metrics to assess the transformative impact of newly proposed discoveries, as current methods predominantly rely on subjective expert alignment rather than quantitative evaluations of scientific breakthroughs."
