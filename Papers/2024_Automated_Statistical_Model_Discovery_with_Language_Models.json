  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to introduce a method for language model-driven automated statistical model discovery, leveraging large language models to propose and critique statistical models without the need for a domain-specific language or handcrafted search procedures.",
    "evidence": "Motivated by the domain knowledge and programming capabilities of large language models (LMs), we introduce a method for language model driven automated statistical model discovery."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Previous systems for automated model discovery required a domain-specific language and handcrafted search procedures, limiting flexibility and requiring significant human expertise.",
    "evidence": "However, in these systems, a human expert had to carefully design a domain specific language (DSL) of models and specify a hand-crafted search procedure for composing models in that DSL."
