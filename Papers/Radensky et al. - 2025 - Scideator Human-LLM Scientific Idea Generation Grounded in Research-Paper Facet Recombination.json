  "objective": {
    "answer": "The primary objective of the paper is to develop and evaluate Scideator, a mixed-initiative, large language model-powered tool for scientific idea generation and novelty evaluation based on research-paper facet recombination. The authors aim to assist scientists in generating novel research ideas by extracting and recombining key facets (purpose, mechanism, evaluation) from input and analogous papers, and to help users assess the originality of these ideas relative to existing literature.",
    "evidence": "In this work, we present Scideator, an LLM-powered tool for facet-based scientific idea generation and novelty evaluation. Scideator employs a human-AI approach (Fig 1). To begin, the user provides an ideation topic and set of input papers that they would like to use as a starting point for ideation. Scideator extracts key facets (purpose, mechanism, and evaluation) from the input papers... The tool generates analogies involving the candidate facets and produces ideas based on the most promising ones. Based on relevant retrieved literature and carefully constructed in-context examples, Scideator then provides a novelty classification and reason for proposed ideas, making it easy for scientists to verify the tool’s assessment."
  },
  "knowledge_gap": {
    "answer": "Existing approaches to scientific ideation do not adequately support facet-based recombination of research concepts or provide integrated, interactive novelty evaluation, making it difficult for scientists to efficiently generate and assess novel research ideas.",
    "evidence": "However, generating research ideas by recombining concepts from research papers is difficult for multiple reasons. For one, scientists must wade through an ever-expanding literature to find relevant concepts [6, 31]. Moreover, the phenomenon of fixation biases scientists against considering more diverse concepts and concept recombinations; instead, they are predisposed to think about a problem in familiar terms, which hinders the stimulation of novel ideas [18, 57]. Even if a scientist manages to identify interesting concept recombinations to form potential research ideas, assessing the ideas’ novelty relative to existing literature is a cumbersome yet critical task."
